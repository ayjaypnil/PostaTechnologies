                        as liability for infringement of intellectual property rights. These Terms will govern any updates

                        by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.
                        <br>
                        <br> 4. Payment Terms
                        <br>
                        <br> 4.1. General Payment Terms
                        <br>
                        <br> You understand that the prices for services displayed through the App may differ from the prices
                        offered or published by merchants for the same service and/or from prices available at other third-party
                        websites and that such prices may not be the lowest prices at which the services are sold. Please
                        note that in some cases, the estimated pricing published through the Service at time of checkout
                        or request may differ from the prevailing pricing; for instance, a trip may cost more for in some
                        circumstances than is estimated. POSTA reserves the right to determine final prevailing pricing of
                        all services ordered through the Service. In cases in which prevailing pricing is different than
                        the estimated pricing, the fees you are ultimately charged may be different than the estimate. You
                        acknowledge and agree to pay the prevailing pricing and fees. Please visit or email, whichever is
                        applicable, our Help Center (tryposta@gmail.com) to learn more about how services are priced. POSTA
                        has no obligation to itemize its costs, profits or margins when publishing prices on the Site or
                        in the App and reserves the right to change such prices at any time, at its discretion. You are liable
                        for all transaction taxes on the Services provided under this Agreement (other than taxes based on
                        POSTA income). Certain features of the Service, including placing requests, may require you to pay
                        fees. POSTA may change, or add, fees for our Service at any time as we deem necessary or appropriate
                        for our business. You will have an opportunity to review and accept an estimate of the fees that
                        you will be charged, as applicable. The final fees may differ from the estimate, which may be the
                        result of any requested substitutions or the ultimate prevailing price of the items (discussed above).
                        In some cases we may not be able to provide an estimate of the fees, such as when we are otherwise
                        unable to predict all fees. In all cases, you acknowledge and accept that a fee will be charged and
                        you agree to pay said fee. We encourage you to check our Site or visit our Help Center (tryposta@gmail.com)
                        to learn more about how we charge for the Service. POSTA will charge the payment method you specify
                        at the time of purchase or as otherwise specified by you in your account information. Charges paid
                        by you are final and non-refundable, except as expressly provided in Section 4.2, and will be quoted
                        in the local currency of the location where the order is being delivered. Except as expressly provided
                        in Section 4.2, POSTA has no obligation to provide refunds or credits, but may grant them, in each
                        case in POSTA sole discretion and regardless of your decision to terminate your usage, our decision
                        to terminate your usage, and/or any disruption caused to our Service for any reason whatsoever. POSTA,
                        in its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different rates to
                        any of our customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, shall have no bearing whatsoever
                        on your use of the Service or fees charged to you. POSTA reserves its right to expire or modify any
                        promotion at any time.
                        <br>
                        <br> 4.3. Payment Authorization You authorize POSTA to charge all sums for requests that you make and
                        services you select to the payment method designated in your account. When you order on POSTA, a
                        temporary pre-authorization hold may be placed on your designated payment method to verify that the
                        card is valid and has funds available for your intended purchase. The amount of this pre-authorization
                        hold may be greater or less than the order total quoted at checkout. However, you will only be charged
                        the final order total once your order is registered as complete within the POSTA system, which generally
                        occurs between 24-48 business hours after you receive your order. In the event that the pre-authorization
                        is greater than the final amount, the difference will be returned to you after your order is completed
                        or cancelled, which may take up to 5 business days depending on your bank. POSTA may also place an
                        initial temporary pre-authorization hold on each new payment method you add to your account. POSTA
                        reserves the right to request additional information from you if we have reason to believe, in our
                        sole discretion, that a payment method may be fraudulent.
                        <br>
                        <br> 4.4. Delinquent Accounts If payment for purchases on your account is delinquent, your account information
                        may be sent to a collection agency / debt collector and you may be subject to a collection action,
                        and payment of collection related fees and costs. If you have questions regarding an outstanding
                        balance on your account, please contact us via our Help Center (tryposta@gmail.com).
                        <br>
                        <br> 4.5. Customer Not Available POSTA reserves the right to charge a customer the full order amount
                        if that customer is not at the designated delivery location when the courier arrives to complete
                        the delivery. In addition, if the customer is unavailable, the items sent may be returned by the
                        courier to the original requesting party and a fee may apply. In addition, the item may be held by
                        the company in order to better facilitate the transaction. WE TAKE NO RESPONSIBIITY IN ITEMS THAT
                        ARE SENT ON THE NETWORK.
                        <br>
                        <br> 4.6 Cancelled Orders If you cancel your POSTA order you may be charged depending on what stage the
                        order was in when you cancelled. If you cancel a delivery after it has been accepted but is not yet
                        being prepared by the courier, you will not be charged a cancellation fee. If you cancel a delivery
                        after a courier has started the service, you may be charged a cancellation fee of up to $5. You CANNOT
                        cancel a delivery after confirmations are received and it is out for delivery.
                        <br>
                        <br> 4.7 Returned Items If an item has to be returned for any reason, you may be subject to a non-refundable
                        fee or fee to up to the original service price. Posta is NOT responsible for items sent on the network.

                        <br> 5. Third-Party Interactions
                        <br> 5.1. Third-Party Providers During use of the Service, you may send items to third-parties through

                        associated with that activity, is solely between you and the applicable third party. POSTA and its
                        licensors shall have no liability, obligation or responsibility for any purchase or transaction between
                        you and any third-party provider. In no event shall POSTA or its licensors be responsible for services
                        or other materials on or available from third-party sites or third-party providers. Certain third
                        parties may require your agreement to additional or different terms and conditions prior to your
                        use of or access to such goods or services, and POSTA disclaims any and all responsibility or liability
                        arising from such agreements between you and a third party.
                        <br>

                        or responsibility for any interaction between you and any Courier.

                        <br>
                        <br> 17.1. Disputes POSTA is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations
                        or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions,
                        interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other user, any Courier or
                        other third party. Disputes between a user and POSTA are subject to this Section 17.
                        <br>
                        <br> 17.2. Generally In the interest of resolving disputes between you and POSTA in the most expedient
                        and cost effective manner, you and POSTA agree that every dispute arising in connection with these
                        Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
                        Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery
                        than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same
                        damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims
                        arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute,
                        fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during
                        or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS,
                        YOU AND POSTA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
                        <br>
                        <br> 17.3. Exceptions Despite the provisions of the paragraph directly above, we both agree that nothing
                        in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either of us to:
                        a. Bring an individual action in small claims court; b. Pursue an enforcement action through the
                        applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; c. Seek injunctive relief
                        in a court of law; or d. To file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement
                        claim.
                        <br>
                        <br> 17.4. Arbitrator Any arbitration between you and POSTA will be governed by the Commercial Dispute
                        Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively,
                        "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms, and will
                        be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by
                        calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting POSTA at tryposta@gmail.com.
                        <br>
                        <br> 17.5. Notice Process A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of
                        the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or if we do
                        not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). POSTA address for Notice
                        is listed in the terms. The Notice must: a. Describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;
                        and b. Set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand") We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve
                        the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice
                        is received, you or POSTA may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount
                        of any settlement offer made by you or POSTA must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after
                        the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If our dispute is finally resolved through
                        arbitration in your favor, POSTA will pay you the highest of the following: I. The amount awarded
                        by the arbitrator, if any; II. The last written settlement amount offered by POSTA in settlement
                        of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or III. $1,000
                        <br>
                        <br> 17.6. Fees If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, POSTA will reimburse you
                        for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the
                        payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at
                        a location to be agreed upon by POSTA, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether
                        the arbitration will be conducted: a. Solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator;
                        b. Through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or c. By an in-person hearing as established
                        by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address If the arbitrator finds that either
                        the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper
                        purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the
                        payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse POSTA
                        for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA
                        Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue
                        a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which
                        the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as
                        to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request
                        from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
                        <br>
                        <br> 17.7. No Class Actions YOU AND POSTA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN
                        YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
                        REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and POSTA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may
                        not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative
                        or class proceeding.
                        <br>
                        <br> 17.8. Modifications If POSTA makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a
                        change to POSTA address for Notice), you may reject the change by sending us written notice within
                        30 days of the change to POSTA address for Notice, in which case your account with POSTA will be
                        immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments
                        you reject, will survive.
                        <br>
                        <br> 17.9. Enforceability If Section 17.7 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section
                        17 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 17 will be null and void and,
                        in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 20
                        will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.
                        <br>
                        <br> 18. Modification of these Terms We reserve the right to update or modify the Terms at any time without
                        prior notice, and such changes will be effective immediately upon being posted through the Service,
                        except as set forth below. These Terms identify the date of last update. Your use of the Service
                        following any such change constitutes your agreement to be bound by the modified Terms of Service.
                        In the case of material changes to these Terms, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of
                        the change, such as through sending an email to any address you may have used to register for an
                        account, through a pop-up window on the Service, or other similar mechanism. Material changes to
                        these Terms will be effective upon the earlier of: Your first use of the Service with actual notice
                        of such change, or 30 days from posting of such change. Disputes arising under these Terms will be
                        resolved in accordance with the version of the Terms in place at the time the dispute arose. We encourage
                        you to review these Terms frequently to stay informed of the latest modifications.
                        <br>
                        <br> 19. Confidentiality You acknowledge and agree that when using the App, you may have direct or indirect
                        access or exposure to POSTA confidential information ("Confidential Information"). Confidential Information
                        includes POSTA data, provider IDs, user information, delivery recipient information, delivery provider
                        information, package information, and the transaction volume, marketing and business plans, business,
                        financial, technical, operational and such other nonpublic information (whether disclosed in writing
                        or verbally) that POSTA designates as being proprietary or confidential or that you should reasonably
                        know to treat as confidential. You acknowledge and agree that: (a) all Confidential Information shall
                        remain the exclusive property of the POSTA; (b) you shall not use Confidential Information for any
                        purpose except in furtherance of your use of the App; (c) you shall not disclose Confidential Information
                        to any third party; and (d) you shall not store or keep Confidential Information and shall return
                        or destroy (with confirmation of destruction) all Confidential Information upon the termination of
                        your use of the App or at the request of POSTA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information
                        shall not include any information to the extent it: (a) is or becomes part of the public domain through
                        no action or omission by you; (b) was possessed by you prior to your use of the App without an obligation
                        of confidentiality; or (c) is disclosed to you by a third party having no obligation of confidentiality
                        with respect thereto.
                        <br>
                        <br> 20. General These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Illinois without regard to conflict
                        of law principles. If a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms, you and POSTA
                        agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts
                        located within Cook County, IL for the purpose of litigating any dispute. We operate the Service
                        from our offices in Illinois, and we make no representation that materials included in the Service
                        are appropriate or available for use in other locations. No joint venture, partnership, employment,
                        or agency relationship exists between you, POSTA or any third-party provider as a result of the Terms
                        or use of the Service. If any provision of the Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable,
                        such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced to the fullest extent
                        under law. The failure of POSTA to enforce any right or provision in this Agreement shall not constitute
                        a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by POSTA in writing. This Agreement
                        comprises the entire agreement between you and POSTA and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
                        negotiations, discussions or agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties regarding the
                        subject matter contained in these Terms.
                        <br>
                        <br> 21. Notice Regarding Apple To the extent that you are using our mobile applications on an iOS device,
                        you further acknowledge and agree to the terms of this Section 21. You acknowledge that these Terms
                        are between you and POSTA only, not with Apple Inc. ("Apple"), and Apple is not responsible for the
                        Service and the content thereof. Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and
                        support services with respect to the Service. In the event of any failure of the Service to conform
                        to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple will refund any applicable purchase price
                        for the mobile application to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple
                        has no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Service. Apple is not responsible
                        for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the Service or your possession and/or
                        use of the Service, including, but not limited to: I. Product liability claims; II. Any claim that
                        the Service fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and III. Claims arising
                        under consumer protection or similar legislation Apple is not responsible for the investigation,
                        defense, settlement and discharge of any third-party claim that the Service and/or your possession
                        and use of the mobile application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights. You
                        agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms when using the Service. Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries
                        are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will
                        have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you
                        as a third-party beneficiary of these Terms. You hereby represent and warrant that: I. You are not
                        located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by
                        the U.S. Government as a "terrorist supporting" country; and II. You are not listed on any U.S. Government
                        list of prohibited or restricted parties
